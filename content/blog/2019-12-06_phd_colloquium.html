<p>Last Thursday, on November 28th, 2019, our annual PhD colloquium took place at the Earth Observation Center (EOC) at DLR in Oberpfaffenhofen. As every year, the current PhD students of Prof. Dr. Stefan Dech met to present the concepts and statuses of their PhDs and to discuss their approaches and ideas within a larger group. As last year, the presentations provided interesting insights into the accomplishments and challenges of the PhD projects and showed the scientific progress that has been made during this last year. The presentations were followed by vivid discussions, out of which valuable thoughts evolved, allowing the PhD students to get inputs from different perspectives.</p>
<p>Below, the attending speakers and the titles of their presentations are listed:</p>
<p><em>Alexandra Bell:</em>
Remote Sensing for policy and decision making</p>
<p><em>Dorothee Stiller:</em>
Big Earth Data for urban traffic applications</p>
<p><em>Matthias Weigand:</em>
STAGE – The influence of the surrounding urban environment on the health of the people in Germany</p>
<p><em>and myself:</em>
Potentials of animal-environment interactions for remote sensing research</p>
<p>We were joined by our PhD supervisor Prof. Dech and PhD mentors Doris Klein, Martin Wegmann, Hannes Taubenböck and Michael Wurm.</p>
