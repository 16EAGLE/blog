Welcome at [jakob.schwalb-willmann.de](https://jakob.schwalb-willmann.de), a page about what I do and what I am professionally interested in. This includes spatial data science, Earth observation, geoanalysis, animal movement tracking, risk detection, pattern mining & recognition techniques, machine learning for computer vision problems and software development. I like forests, open source and outer space.

I am a spatial data scientist, specialized in Earth observation and geo-spatial data analysis. Professionally, I am passionate about jointly analyzing movement tracking data and temporally synchronous environmental data acquired by satellites that orbit the Earth in space. My research primarily aims to utilize animals as environmental agents by letting a computer learn patterns in the interaction of animal movement behaviors and prevalent environmental conditions to predict such environmental conditions from movement data.

Currently, I am working at the [Department of Remote Sensing](https://www.geographie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/fernerkundung/startseite/) of the [University of Wuerzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/), where I am conducting my PhD research in cooperation with the [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5227/) and the [Max Planck Institue for Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/).
