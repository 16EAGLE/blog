## 2025

<details>
  <summary>Seminar **"Introduction into remote sensing for ecological analyses"**, [Biology MSc., University of Würzburg](https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/biostudium/master/)</summary>
  <p>In this course, ecology students are introduced to remote sensing and geo-analysis for ecological research applications and learn to independently use remote sensing in their own research fields. In the first week, students are introduced to remote sensing and geo-spatial data and methods and learn to use `QGIS` and `R` for geo-spatial analysis. In the second week, they apply remote sensing and geo-analysis to answer their own real-world ecological research questions. At the end of the course, they present their remote-sensing-enabled findings.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 10 sessions (full days, 2-weeks block)*</p>

  <summary>Guest Lecture **"Satellite and UAV remote sensing for arctic ecology research"**, [Arctic Winter Ecology MSc., UNIS, Svalbard](https://www.unis.no/courses/ab-329-arctic-winter-ecology/)</summary>
  <p>In this guest lecture, Arctic winter ecology MSc. students were introduced to satellite and UAV remote sensing and geo-analysis for ecological research applications in the Arctic. The guest lecture was hold on invitation by [Prof. Dr. Simone Lang (UNIS)](https://www.unis.no/staff/simone-lang/) as part of a six-week international [MSc. course on Arctic winter ecology](https://www.unis.no/courses/ab-329-arctic-winter-ecology/). On the first day, students were introduced to remote sensing research applications, physical principles of remote sensing and fundamental methods for remote sensing data analysis. In an hands-on session, they learned to handle, visualize and analyze remote sensing data from both Earth observation satellites and Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using geo-spatial software, including *QGIS* and `R`. Afterwards, students were introduced to UAV remote sensing sensors and platforms as well as mission planning. The day finished with the design of a real-world field campaign for the next day, including in-situ snow data collection and UAV thermal and LiDAR data collection using two drones. On the second day, students learned in the field how to in-situ collecting snow parameters,, including snow depth, snow wetness, snow temperatures, snow hardness etc. To geo-locate in-situ measurements with high accuracy, students learned to use real-time kinematic (RTK) corrected GPS. Afterwards, two UAV systems were flown to map the research area, equipped with a thermal and a LiDAR sensor. Later-on, students had the chance to experiment with the data they had collected themselves, e.g. by validating UAV-derived snow depth or snow temperature data against their own measurements. The data collected during the course are of high potential value for Arctic ecology research, as they can be used to quantify the impact of snow properties on vegetation phenology and resource development in spring and summer.</p>

  <summary>Seminar **"Deep learning for Earth observation"**, [EAGLE MSc., University of Würzburg](https://eagle-science.org)</summary>
  <p>This methodological course introduces *Deep Learning* with a practical focus on how to use it for image processing in Earth observation. Students get to know the principles behind the design of Neural Networks and the training thereof using *Deep Learning*.

  <summary>Seminar **"Animal movement tracking data analysis for Earth observation"**, [EAGLE MSc., University of Würzburg](https://eagle-science.org)</summary>
  <p>This modelling course introduces concepts and methods to Earth observation students who want to learn to work with animal movement trajectories, a special type of spatio-temporal data, and integrate such with Earth observation analyses. The course aims to find data-driven answers to questions such as: Why do animals move through the landscape the way they do? How are they impacted by their environments? And: Which environmental conditions are tied to what kind of of movement behavior? While the course introduces background knowledge on topics such as movement theory, the effects of discretely observing continuous processes (e.g. sampling rate, autocorrelation, bias etc.), scale-dependencies/matching, tracking approaches and location error, its practical focus lays on methods to handle and analyze tracking data (e.g. using geometric & variance component analyses, behavioral segmentation, area-metrics such as home ranges, remote-sensing driven trajectory analysis incl. corridor analysis & habitat analysis) as well as tracking data in combination with remotely sensed environmental data (e.g. through resource utilization modelling, resource selection modelling and step selection modelling). This leads students to eventually be able to independently spot patterns in movement data, make connections to environmental conditions, and, finally, jointly model movement tracking and remotely sensed environmental data.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 5 sessions (full days, 1-week block)*</p>
