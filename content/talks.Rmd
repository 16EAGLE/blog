<figcaption>*Teaching at the AniMove Science School 2019 at Yale University, USA*</figcaption>

*Since 2019, I have a teaching position at the University of WÃ¼rzburg. In addition, I have been teaching at the AniMove Science Schools for several years. Find out about my talks and teaching below.*

## 2023

<details>
<summary>Seminar **"Introduction into programming and geo-statistics"**, [EAGLE MSc.](http://eagle-science.org)</summary>
  <p>Basics of `R` & *QGIS*; version control using *git*; `R` in comparison to other languages (interpreter vs. compiler, memory management etc.); programming paradigms; procedural vs. object-oriented vs. functional programming; types/modes, structures, indexing; implicit vs. explicit type conversion; control flow constructs & vectorization; functions; package building; data visualization; statistics; spatial data analysis; image processing; classification models etc.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 12 sessions (1.5 hours each)*</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Seminar **"Deep learning for Earth observation"**, [EAGLE MSc.](https://eagle-science.org)</summary>
  <p>This methodological course introduces *Deep Learning* with a practical focus on how to use it for image processing in Earth observation. Students get to know the principles behind the design of Neural Networks and the training thereof using *Deep Learning*. They learn about loss, backpropagation, optimization, activation functions & vanishing gradients, over- & underfitting, regularization, augmentation, convolutions, layers of state vs. stateless layers, sequential and non-sequential network designs for image processing tasks such as classification and segmentation etc. The course is taught in `R` and `Pyhton`, mainly using `keras` and `tensorflow`.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 12 sessions (1.5 hours each)*</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Seminar **"Remote sensing field methods for ecological analyses"**, [Biology MSc.](https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/biostudium/master/)</summary>
  <p>This course introduces remote sensing field methods to ecologists. They are get to know field campaigning (sampling methods, routing, positioning etc.), in-situ data sampling (parameters, field devices such as spectrometers, soil moisture probes etc.) and UAS (drone) imagery acquisition (platforms, sensors, flight planning, licensing, training). This prepares them for a field day at a research site where data are collected under real-world research conditions. Afterwards, they learn to handle, process and analyse the recorded data and turn them into interpretable information.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 10 sessions (full days, 2-weeks block)*</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Seminar **"Animal movement tracking data analysis for Earth observation"**, [EAGLE MSc.](https://eagle-science.org)</summary>
  <p>This modelling course introduces concepts and methods to Earth observation students who want to learn to work with animal movement trajectories, a special type of spatio-temporal data, and integrate such with Earth observation analyses. The course aims to find data-driven answers to questions such as: Why do animals move through the landscape the way they do? How are they impacted by their environments? And: Which environmental conditions are tied to what kind of of movement behavior? While the course introduces background knowledge on topics such as movement theory, the effects of discretely observing continuous processes (e.g. sampling rate, autocorrelation, bias etc.), scale-dependencies/matching, tracking approaches and location error, its practical focus lays on methods to handle and analyze tracking data (e.g. using geometric & variance component analyses, behavioral segmentation, area-metrics such as home ranges, remote-sensing driven trajectory analysis incl. corridor analysis & habitat analysis) as well as tracking data in combination with remotely sensed environmental data (e.g. through resource utilization modelling, resource selection modelling and step selection modelling). This leads students to eventually be able to independently spot patterns in movement data, make connections to environmental conditions, and, finally, jointly model movement tracking and remotely sensed environmental data.</p>
  <p>*Duration: 5 sessions (full days, 1-week block)*</p>
