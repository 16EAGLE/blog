## 2020

Seminar **"Advanced Programming for Spatial Analysis"**, [EAGLE MSc.](http://eagle-science.org): Practical training to strengthen technical and methodological skills in machine learning (deep neural networks for computer vision, deep learning, discriminative modeling), machine-to-machine communication and creating efficient local and cloud-based development environments for `Python` and `R`.

Seminar **"Scientific Graphics"**, [EAGLE MSc.](http://eagle-science.org): Training to improve skills in creating scientific graphics using `R` and `LaTeX`, and communicating scientific work through web applications using shiny in `R`.

Seminar (Block) **"Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagery"**, [EAGLE MSc.](http://eagle-science.org): Introduction to spectral unmixing theory, physical principles, established methods and practical tools using `QGIS` and `R`.
