<p>Welcome at <a href="https://jakob.schwalb-willmann.de">jakob.schwalb-willmann.de</a>, a page about what I do and what I am interested in! I am a <strong>spatial data scientist</strong>, specialized in <strong>Earth observation</strong> and <strong>geo-spatial data</strong> analysis. Professionally, I am passionate about tapping into new data sources that are currently underutilized in Earth observation research, integrating them with existing data, and <strong>finding patterns</strong> previously undetected. For this, I am developing and applying <strong>machine and deep learning</strong> techniques.</p>
<p>For example, I am fascinated by the idea of employing animals as environmental informants by tracking them on large global scales and then letting a computer learn patterns in their interactions with the environment. To detect and utilize such <strong>animal-environment interactions</strong> for Earth observation, I have been using deep learning to jointly analyze global animal movement tracking data and temporally synchronous environmental data acquired by satellites.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.geographie.uni-wuerzburg.de/erdbeobachtung/">Earth Observation Research Cluster (EORC)</a> of the <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/">University of Wuerzburg</a>, where I am part of the <a href="http://uas.remote-sensing.org/">UAV Team</a>. There, we fly <strong>drones</strong> equipped with various sensors to conduct <strong>ecological research</strong> in cooperation with partners located around the world – from the African savannas through German temperate forests to the Arctic tundra. We use <strong>predictive modelling</strong> to turn remote sensing data into information of value for ecological applications.</p>
<p>I am <a href="/talks">teaching</a> students in the international <a href="http://eagle-science.org/">EAGLE MSc. programme</a> (Earth Observation and Geoanalysis) and the <a href="https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/masterbiosciences/">Biosciences MSc. programme</a> (Ecology) at University of Würzburg, where I hold a lecturer position since 2019. In cooperation with the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5227/">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ab.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institue for Animal Behavior</a>, I investigated the potentials of animal-environment interactions for remote sensing research as part of my doctoral studies (2019 to 2025).</p>
<p>You can find me elsewhere on the web <a href="https://www.geographie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/earthobservation/staff/schwalb-willmann-jakob-msc/">here</a> and <a href="http://eagle-science.org/schwalb-willmann/">here</a> or on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schwalb-willmann.de">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://github.com/16eagle">GitHub</a>.
