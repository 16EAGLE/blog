<p>This page is about what I do and what I am interested in. I am a spatial data scientist, specialized in Earth observation and geo-spatial data analysis. Professionally, I am passionate about tapping into new data sources that are currently underutilized in Earth observation research, integrating them with existing data and, in joint analysis, finding patterns previously undetected. For this, I am developing and applying machine and deep learning techniques.</p>
<p>For example, for the past years, I have been working on jointly analyzing global animal movement tracking data and temporally synchronous environmental data, acquired by satellites in space. I am fascinated by the idea of employing animals as environmental informants by tracking them on large global scales and letting a computer learn patterns in their interactions with the environment.</p>
<p>Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.geographie.uni-wuerzburg.de/erdbeobachtung/">Earth Observation Research Cluster (EORC)</a> of the <a href="https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/home/">University of Wuerzburg</a>, where I am part of the <a href="http://uas.remote-sensing.org/">UAS Team</a>. There, we fly drones equipped with various sensors for ecological research applications in cooperation with partners located around the world – from the African savannas through German temperate forests to the Arctic tundra.</p>
<p>I am <a href="/talks">teaching</a> teaching students in the international <a href="http://eagle-science.org/">EAGLE MSc. programme</a> (Earth Observation and Geoanalysis) and the <a href="https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/masterbiosciences/">Biosciences MSc. programme</a> (Ecology) at University of Würzburg, where I hold a lecturer position since 2019. In cooperation with the <a href="https://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-5227/">German Aerospace Center (DLR)</a> and the <a href="https://www.ab.mpg.de/">Max Planck Institue for Animal Behavior</a>, I am conducting my PhD research on the potentials of animal-environment interactions for remote sensing research.</p>
