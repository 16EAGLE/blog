<h2>2023</h2>
<p>Seminar <strong>“Deep learning for Earth observation”</strong>, <a href="https://eagle-science.org">EAGLE MSc.</a>: This methodological course introduces <em>Deep Learning</em> with a practical focus on how to use it for image processing in Earth observation. Students get to know the principles behind the design of Neural Networks and the training thereof using <em>Deep Learning</em>. They learn about loss, backpropagation, optimization, activation functions &amp; vanishing gradients, over- &amp; underfitting, regularization, augmentation, convolutions, layers of state vs. stateless layers, sequential and non-sequential network designs for image processing tasks such as classification and segmentation. The course is taught in <code>R</code> and <code>Pyhton</code>, mainly using <code>keras</code> and <code>tensorflow</code>.</p>
<p>Seminar <strong>“Remote sensing field methods for ecological analyses”</strong>, <a href="https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/biostudium/master/">Biology MSc.</a>: This course introduces remote sensing field methods to ecologists. They are get to know field campaigning (sampling methods, routing, positioning etc.), in-situ data sampling (parameters, field devices such as spectrometers, soil moisture probes etc.) and UAS (drone) imagery acquisition (platforms, sensors, flight planning, licensing, training). This prepares them for a field day at a research site where data are collected under real-world research conditions. Afterwards, they learn to handle, process and analyse the recorded data and turn them into interpretable information.</p>
<p>Seminar <strong>“Animal movement tracking data analysis for Earth observation”</strong>, <a href="https://eagle-science.org">EAGLE MSc.</a>: Why do animals move through the landscape in the way they do? How are they impacted by their environments? Or: Which environmental conditions are tied to what kind of of movement behavior? People interested in conservation efforts, biodiversity research or climate change impact predictions, among others, may be asking these kind of questions. Integrating animal movement tracking data with remotely-sensed environmental data may allow researchers to provide answers. This modelling course introduces concepts and methods to Earth observation students who want to learn to work with animal movement trajectories, a special type of spatio-temporal data, and integrate such with Earth observation analyses. While touching backgrounds of movement theory, the course mainly focuses on practically handling, analyzing and visualizing tracking data, leading students to eventually be able to independently spot patterns in movement data, make connections to environmental conditions and, finally, jointly model movement tracking and remote sensing/environmental data.</p>
