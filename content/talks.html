Seminar <strong>“Animal movement tracking data analysis for Earth observation”</strong>, <a href="https://eagle-science.org">EAGLE MSc.</a>
</summary>
<p>
This modelling course introduces concepts and methods to Earth observation students who want to learn to work with animal movement trajectories, a special type of spatio-temporal data, and integrate such with Earth observation analyses. The course aims to find data-driven answers to questions such as: Why do animals move through the landscape the way they do? How are they impacted by their environments? And: Which environmental conditions are tied to what kind of of movement behavior? While the course introduces background knowledge on topics such as movement theory, the effects of discretely observing continuous processes (e.g. sampling rate, autocorrelation, bias etc.), scale-dependencies/matching, tracking approaches and location error, its practical focus lays on methods to handle and analyze tracking data (e.g. using geometric &amp; variance component analyses, behavioral segmentation, area-metrics such as home ranges, remote-sensing driven trajectory analysis incl. corridor analysis &amp; habitat analysis) as well as tracking data in combination with remotely sensed environmental data (e.g. through resource utilization modelling, resource selection modelling and step selection modelling). This leads students to eventually be able to independently spot patterns in movement data, make connections to environmental conditions, and, finally, jointly model movement tracking and remotely sensed environmental data.

Seminar <strong>“Remote sensing field methods for ecological analyses”</strong>, <a href="https://www.biologie.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/biostudium/master/">Biology MSc.</a>
</summary>
<p>
This course introduces remote sensing field methods to ecologists. They are get to know field campaigning (sampling methods, routing, positioning etc.), in-situ data sampling (parameters, field devices such as spectrometers, soil moisture probes etc.) and UAS (drone) imagery acquisition (platforms, sensors, flight planning, licensing, training). This prepares them for a field day at a research site where data are collected under real-world research conditions. Afterwards, they learn to handle, process and analyse the recorded data and turn them into interpretable information.
